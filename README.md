Developed an online Learning Management System that administers, provides tracking, reporting, automation and delivery of educational videos and programs in a digitalised package evolving the concept of e-Learning. The entire project is made with the help of PHP, HTML, Bootstrap, Python,Javascript and MySQL. Students and Teachers can join or create class, make announcements, create assignment submissions, quizzes to check performance and upload lectures for later reference as a part of communication. The system simplifies and learning activities and organises coursework under one roof creating an atmosphere of a “School on a Website”.
